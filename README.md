# Tilt Technical Interview - Candidate Guide

## What to Expect
This is a **live code review interview** where you'll inspect, analyze, and improve a pre-built iOS Disney character browsing app. You'll be working with real code that has intentional issues for you to identify and solve.

During the interview, you will be asked to share your screen so you can walk the
interviewer through the code and your problem-solving process.

## Interview Format (45-50 minutes)
1. **Code Exploration** (15 min): Analyze the existing codebase
2. **Problem Solving** (20 min): Fix identified issues
3. **Feature Enhancement** (15 min): Add or improve functionality
4. **Q&A** (5 min): Questions and wrap-up

## Pre-Interview Preparation

### Technical Setup
- **Xcode**: Ensure you have Xcode installed and working
- **Simulator**: Make sure iOS Simulator runs properly
- **Git**: Basic git knowledge for cloning the repository
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for API calls

### What to Review
- **MVVM Architecture**: Understand Model-View-ViewModel pattern
- **UIKit Fundamentals**: TableViews, ViewControllers, Auto Layout
- **Memory Management**: Weak/strong references, retain cycles
- **Threading**: Main queue vs background queues
- **Networking**: URLSession, JSON parsing, error handling









## Final Tips

### Before the Interview:
- **Practice with real code**: Review existing iOS projects
- **Brush up on fundamentals**: Memory management, threading, networking
- **Prepare questions**: Have thoughtful questions about the role and team

### During the Interview:
- **Stay calm**: Take your time to understand before acting
- **Communicate clearly**: Explain your thinking process
- **Be collaborative**: This is a discussion, not an exam
- **Show enthusiasm**: Demonstrate genuine interest in the problem

### Remember:
- **Process matters**: How you approach problems is as important as the solution
- **It's okay to not know**: Ask questions and admit when you're unsure
- **Learn from feedback**: Use hints and guidance to improve your approach
- **Show growth mindset**: Demonstrate willingness to learn and adapt

Good luck! Remember, this is as much about demonstrating your thought process and communication skills as it is about technical ability.
